        <p class="card-text" style="font-family: 'Jost', sans-serif; font-size: 20px;"><b>April 30, 2020</b> As many as 100 US companies keen on exiting China after the Covid-19 pandemic are seriously considering Uttar Pradesh as their new destination.<br>
        Uttar Pradesh’s minister in charge of MSMEs Siddharth Nath Singh on Tuesday engaged with them through a webinar, organised by the United States-India Strategic Partnership Forum. Representatives of these companies showed interest in the fields of agriculture, electronics, medicine, scientific instrumentation, logistics, defence, aviation, food processing MRO, etc. The companies include Lockheed Martin, Adobe, Honeywell, Boston Scientific and Cisco Systems as well as global delivery services providers like UPS and FedEx.<br>
        scope of investment in UP and informed them that the state is home to more than 90 lakh MSMEs and skilled labour. With a stable government in the state, coupled with creation of a robust support infrastructure in terms of roads, water supply, irrigation capacity and 24×7 power supply, UP is among the frontrunners on the growth trajectory among large states of the nation,” Singh said.<br>
      It may be mentioned that only a day before, Prime Minister Modi had advised the states to turn the coronavirus crisis into an opportunity. In fact, even before the PM’s advice, chief minister Yogi Adityanath had tasked his ministers and officials with the job of chalking out ways in which the state can woo industries moving out of China after the outbreak of the coronavirus.</p>

        <h1 class="card-title">UV Blaster: DRDO develops WiFi-enabled UV disinfection tower</h1>
        <p class="card-text" style="font-family: 'Jost', sans-serif; font-size: 20px;"><b>April 30, 2020</b> The Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) has developed an ultraviolet (UV) disinfection tower that can be used for rapid and chemical-free disinfection of infection-prone areas. It is likely to prove useful at a time when the novel coronavirus pandemic has disrupted normal life across India.<br>
         equipment named "UV blaster" is a UV-based area sanitizer designed and developed by Laser Science & Technology Centre (LASTEC), DRDO's Delhi-based premier laboratory. The Centre has developed it with the help of "New Age Instruments and Materials Private Limited, Gurugram," adds the note.

The note further adds, "The equipment has six lamps each with 43 watts of UV-C power at 254 nm wavelength for 360-degree illumination. For a room of about 12 x 12 feet dimension, the disinfection time is about 10 minutes and 30 minutes for 400 square feet area by positioning the equipment at different places within the room."<br>
In addition, the UV blaster is also a user-friendly device that can be used by remote operation through laptop/mobile phone using a Wi-Fi link. This sanitiser switches off on the accidental opening of a room or human intervention. One more salient safety feature of the product is the key to arm operation.
